       A study referenced in the popular magazine Psychology 
       Today concluded that it takes an average of 66 days for a behavior to become automatic. 
       If that’s true, that’s good news for business leaders who have spent the past five months running 
       their companies in ways they never could have imagined. The COVID-19 pandemic is a full-stop on 
       business as usual and a launching pad for organizations to become virtual, digital-centric, 
       and agile—and to do it all at lightning-fast speed.
       Now, as leaders look ahead to the next year and beyond, they’re asking: How do we keep this momentum going? 
       How do we take the best of what we’ve learned and put into practice throughout the pandemic, 
       and make sure it’s woven into everything we do going forward? 
       “Business leaders are saying that they’ve accomplished in 10 days what used to take them 10 months,” 
       says Kate Smaje, a senior partner and global co-leader of McKinsey Digital. 
       “That kind of speed is what’s unleashing a wave of innovation unlike anything we’ve ever seen.”
